I make a lot of blended, smooth green sauces â€“ but this lady is a whole new vibe. Spoonable, chunky, and fun. She is the exact thing I didnâ€™t realize my smoky grilled chicken was needing.

The combination of avocado, pistachio, chives, and lemon is like a mashup of guacamole, gremolata, and springtime brightness and it is SO good.

I know some of you are going to look at the sauce ingredients and think you want a lime in there, but give the lemon a chance. The lemon with the chives and the roasty pistachiosâ€¦ itâ€™s so fresh and unique. I want this for you.




OOH BABY these are so good! My husbandâ€™s favorite dessert is carrot cake, so the bar is high for us to have a really solid house-favorite carrot cake cupcake recipe.

(Iâ€™m also very attached to this carrot cake coffee cake, which is a bit more brunchy, so we now have options.)

They are fluffy and plush with a nice little domed top, but they are also dense and buttery-ish enough to feel like a proper carrot cake!
